This module allows you to write the components of your MapReduce application.

The basic MapReduce components (Mapper, Reducer, RecordReader, etc.)
are provided as abstract classes. Application developers must subclass
them, providing implementations for all methods called by the
framework.

**NOTE:** this module is provided only for backward compatibility support.
If you are writing new code, use the api defined in `pydoop.mapreduce.api`
