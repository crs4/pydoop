Set up communication channels with the MapReduce framework.

If "mapreduce.pipes.command.port" is in the env, this is a "real" Hadoop task:
we have to connect to the given port and use the socket for live communication
with the Java submitter.

If the above env variable is not defined, but "mapreduce.pipes.commandfile"
is, a pre-compiled binary file containing the entire command list from
upstream is available at the specified (local) filesystem path.
